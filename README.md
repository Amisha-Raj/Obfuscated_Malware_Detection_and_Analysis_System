# Malware Detection System

This project aims to develop a malware detection system using machine learning techniques. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, model training, evaluation, and deployment via a Streamlit app.

## Features

- **Data Analysis and Visualization**
  - Distribution of benign and malware classes.
  - Top 20 malware families' distribution.
  - Correlation heatmap of features.
- **Feature Selection**
  - Standardization of features.
  - Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction.
  - Mutual Information for feature ranking.
- **Model Training and Evaluation**
  - Decision Tree, Logistic Regression, and SVM classifiers.
  - Evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, confusion matrix, and ROC-AUC.
- **Interactive Web Application**
  - Upload CSV files for prediction.
  - Generate and download PDF reports of the predictions.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/malware-detection-system.git
   cd malware-detection-system
# Install dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt
# Run the preprocessing and model training script:

python build_model.py
# Run the Streamlit app:

streamlit run app.py
# Usage
Open the Streamlit app in your browser.

Upload a CSV file with the required feature columns.

Click the "Download Predictions PDF" button to get a PDF report with predictions.
